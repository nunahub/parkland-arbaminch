                                Congratulations, Class of 2023! On behalf of the entire Parkland College 
                                Arbaminch community, we are proud to honor you and your achievements at today’s 
                                commencement celebration. Today, your new beginning signals that you have reached 
                                the end of one journey, and now start a new adventure, with new and exciting 
                                challenges and opportunities.
                                <br><br>
                                Commencement is a tradition that marks the intersection of the past and the future. 
                                At Parkland College Arbaminch, we thrive at this intersection, embracing our 
                                state’s vibrant culture founded on wisdom that has been handed down from our 
                                elders—part of a colorful legacy inherited from all those who have shaped the 
                                past, present, and future of this rugged, beautiful land. At the same time, we 
                                look to those same traditions that keep us connected to the lessons of the past 
                                as new inspiration for the forging of our future.
                                <br><br>
                                Today, as we honor your accomplishments as graduates of Parkland College Arbaminch, 
                                we are celebrating your part in our ongoing story, and sharing in the mutual 
                                excitement of a future filled with endless possibilities. Great College foster

                                all aspects of your life.
                                <br><br>

                                you take knowledge to new heights, imagine the impossible, and then work to make 
                                your dreams a reality. With the power of your education, each of you has the 
                                capacity not only to improve your own lives, but the lives of those around you.
