                    <p>
                        R has â€œbecome the de-facto standard for writing statistical software among statisticians. 
                        This Training on Statistical Data Analysis using R will give you a solid foundation 
                        in creating statistical analysis solutions using the R language, and how to carry out 
                        a range of commonly used analytical processes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The overall courses provide the participants with a practical application of the 
                        statistical component of RStudio Statistics. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participants will review several statistical techniques, gain an understanding of when and why to 
                        use these various techniques as well as how to apply them with confidence, interpret their output, 
                        and graphically display the results.

                                    Then youâ€™ll get your hands dirty with analysing data sets covering some big public
