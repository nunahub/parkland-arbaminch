                            Parkland's Back-end development training and certification courses are designed to 
                            teach developers the skills needed to create and maintain the back-end of a website or application. 
                            These courses cover topics such as server-side scripting, database design, and web services. 
                            They also provide hands-on experience with popular back-end development frameworks such as Node.js, 
                            Ruby on Rails, and Django.

                            <dfn>Back-end development</dfn> is the process of creating the server-side of an application. 
                            It is responsible for the core functionality of the application and is used to 
                            store and manipulate data. Major vendors for back-end development include Microsoft, 
                            Oracle, IBM, and Amazon Web Services.

                            Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, 
                            runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Understanding JavaScript: Node.js is built on JavaScript. Thus, a 
                                    course on Node.js would help you understand JavaScript better, as it 
                                    allows JavaScript to run on the server side.
                                </li>
                                <li>Building Scalable Network Applications: Node.js is known for building fast and 
                                    scalable network applications. It's capable of handling numerous simultaneous 
                                    connections with high throughput, which equates to high scalability.
                                </li>
                                <li>Learning Backend Development: The course would give an understanding of back-end 
                                    development and server-side scripting to manage data, user authentication, and 
                                    dynamic responses.
                                </li>
                                <li>API Development: It allows the development of RESTful APIs 
                                    (Application Programming Interface) quickly because of its Express.js 
                                    framework which works on top of Node.js.
                                </li>
                                <li>Real-time Applications: Node.js is also ideal for real-time applications 
                                    such as chats and gaming applications.
                                </li>
                                <li>Mastering Asynchronous Programming: Node.js widely uses asynchronous 
                                    programming because of its single-threaded nature. It enables handling 
                                    multiple requests concurrently. Learning Node.js will help you understand 
                                    this better.
                                </li>
                                <li>Career Enhancement: Being proficient in Node.js can increase job opportunities 
                                    as it's in demand for web development roles in various companies. 
                                    A Node.js course could elevate your portfolio and open doors for web development positions.

                                    that includes new features and syntax. Many Node.js developers use these features, so 
                                    understanding them can be very beneficial.

                                    that where if you have the required skills, it doesn’t matter where you learned them.
                                    You can learn on your own or through structured certification courses. 
                                    If you are completely new to front-end development, you can start with 
                                    beginner courses and move on to more advanced topics.

                                    There is no shortcut to becoming a front-end developer. While some may be 
                                    devoting their full time to learning new coding skills, some may be learning 
                                    it during the little time they have between work and other life commitments. 
                                    However, some people are able to pick up coding concepts a little bit quicker 
                                    than others. The key to balancing it is to set aside some time each day to learn. 
                                    The most important thing is to have fun with it and not rush yourself. 
                                    If you enjoy the learning process, you will be in a much better space to 
                                    learn it quicker than most.

                                    server-side of an application, which is responsible for the core functionality of the 
                                    application. It is used to store and manipulate data, and to create APIs that allow 
                                    the front-end of the application to communicate with the back-end.

                                    and create server-side logic.
